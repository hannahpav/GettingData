This is the final project for Week 4 of the coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data

The goal is to take the test and training data, merge the data into a single set, make a tidy set with the data given, and create a new data set with the average for each activity and subject combination.

CodeBook.md has detailed description of how code works

To Run code, run run_analysis.R script. It will output the new table in the working directory.
